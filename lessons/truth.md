# Truth

## Scripture
- Judges 17:6
- Judges 21:25
- John 14:6

## What is Truth?
What is truth?
The bible talks a lot about truth and mentions it over 200 times in the King James version. While other translations may mentioned the word different amounts, they are still talking about the same thing. Whether you are discussing the bible, laws of physics, or the temperature outside. Truth exists.

## What happens when truth is subjective or people don't care?
If you don't believe in gravity, you just choose for it not be a truth or law of physics. If you jump, what will happen?
Just because you chose to believe "your own truth" doesn't change what truth is.

**Read Judges versions**

So after the Israelites ran out of Egypt, and really through the whole bible, there were periods where people did what they wanted. This is really emphasized in the book of Judges.

- Live in covenant/union with God.
- Do what they want, ignore God's warnings/instructions, and fall out of favour with God.
- Become enslaved by another power/state, and suffer as an entire nation
- Israel cries out to be saved.
- God sends a judge to rescue Israel and bring them back to Him, usually until the Judge dies.

## So how do we define truth?
We have to be careful. The cycle of the Israelites is just as easy to fall into now than it was then. How do we see through all the biased news, opinions, instagram/facebook posts, youtube ads, and daily decisions in our world today?
How do we find our source of truth?

## Truth Is
As we talked about, truth cannot be relative, even if we want it to be sometimes. There are gray areas, and we might not always know what to do, but our standard or truth, where we derive, get, our truth from is from the Bible. Very specifically, from Jesus. While he won't tell us how to balance our budget or what to study for a test, I think we can all get a good idea of what decisions to make from his example. Decisions about how or when to speak, who to date, what path to talk in life are decisions that Jesus, our Truth, can help guide us.

We also be careful of discovering truth alone. Pray for God's help and influence. Parents, Older Youth, Leaders, who have probably been through the same decisions can help interpret the Bible, or at least guide you to places to read.

Whenever you need to be reminded of the Truth, just read the Bible. God's Word is always true.

Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
- John 14:6

## Small Group Discussion
- What are some other sources of right/wrong that could influence someone?
- How much do you Jesus influences your life, actions, decisions compared to there other influences?
- How often do you simple do what is right "in your own eyes"?

God is there for us and for anyone who cries out to him. No matter how many times or how bad they think they screwed up. Just like for the Israelites in Judges, God is always there to save and forgive, without fail.
