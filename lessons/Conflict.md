# Conflict 

## Prove it
- Fruit vs Ice Cream
- Coke vs Pepsi
- Instagram vs Tiktok

## People don't agree, conflict will happen, and it will blindside you.
Romans 12:18
If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.

While we might not want it to happen and some of us may revolve our lives
around staying out of conflict, it will happen.

## Get to the underlying issue
Fighting over things like, get them to raise their hands:
- You don't agree (right vs wrong or difference of opinions)
- Fight and deny when someone is critical of you or points out a weakness/flaw/error
- Someone fights you when you try to be nice to them, because they don't like you.
- Fighting over something that wasn't even said or happened
- Third-party, Sally is upset with you so I am too
- Cranky/Hangry Fighting

## Face to Face
Texts, Emails, and IMs can't convey emotion. 38% is vocal.
You can't see body language over the phone. 55% is visual.
7% verbal.
Sometimes you will find yourself in a fight before you even know it.

## Pray, and get humble

## Listen, Don't take it personally 
Getting angry is not a sin. It's what you do with that anger.

James 1:19
My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,

## Take responsibility for your side
It can be tough to take criticism, especially when you care
When you pour your heart into a project or some work and someone makes fun of it or rips it apart


## Stand your Ground
Especially when it comes to your faith and Jesus, we need to stand our ground.
It's ok not to know an answer but write the question or issue down and figure it out.

## Bring someone if necessary
Referees are good and bible lays out a decent plan for approaching issues.
Matthew 18:15-17

When we fail, remember that we are human and we will fail just like we can't avoid conflict.
While we strive to follow Jesus and his teachings, God is there to forgive us when we fail, every single time.

 Small Group:
 - Talk about a time that you didn't handle conflict very well.
 - Pray about the scenarios and that God will help give patience and wisdom next time
