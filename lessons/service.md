Missions or works, what comes to your mind when I say that?

## Jesus' last words
Acts 1:6-9
Show ancient map.
The impact of Jesus choosing these as his last words.
He mentioned Jerusalem, their safe place/home.
He mentioned Judea, their surrounding area, still familiar.
He mentioned Samaria, the "God would never send me there" place
and finally he mentions, "the ends of the earth", which kind of covers it all.

## A Hard World
At this time, his disciples didn't know what to do, they were looking for comfort and direction.
Life was hard and would be hard.
All the apostles except for John are thought to have been martyred, killed for their faith.
They weren't the only ones. Steven, 29, one of several deacons to give food to the poor.

Book of Acts is the story of the apostles becoming the early church and dealing with a violent world around them.
They shared food, they healed, shared his teachings, and tried to live as Jesus did.

We look at our world. Other parts are violent, just like their world. Ours is gray and truth doesn't matter.

## Be a witness
I'm going to get uncomfortable right now and that's ok.
if we believe in jesus, if we want to follow christ. then we need to love.
we don't like to talk about it because it rubs people the wrong way.
jesus says, he is the only way to heaven. how can we not share his teachings and his love.
It's not easy. The world won't let us directly our faith at times but that doesn't mean we can't stop showing his love.
It's not about standing on street corners or hitting people over the head with a bible.

it's about being his witness. 
Make us sad about things just as social justice, inequality, hate, indifference, the homeless.
Those that have been forgotten such as a lot of seniors or some kids at school.
Those that are ridiculed and bullied.

## Love as Jesus Loved. Break out hearts.
Being a witness means:
that you eat or converse with people that no one else will, or that everyone else looks over.
that you may have to stand up when no one else will.
that you care deeply about those who are hurting.

Slide: Song Hosanna Bridge (Hillsong United, 2007)
I pray and I would love you guys to pray for this as well each day is that God breaks your heart for what breaks his.
That we are saddened, or hurt, or angered by things we see in the world to the point where we act, but we act with love.

## Actions
Next week, Ann is planning some works that will, hopefully, put you out of your comfort zone.
In Acts, God calls us to go out from our comfort zone, to the ends of the world.
Some of you may be called to to do that, others might needs to warming up.
Whichever is you, God wants you to go, to get out, even before your comfortable.
"I'm not ready" or "I can't do that" are not excuses to God.
God's word is not just for you or me. It's for the whole world, and our mission, is to spread his word and his love.
James 2:14-17 NIV

## 2m Challenge
We still have everyday life to go through.
So as we go to small groups, I want to give you a challenge for the next week.

The 2m challenge. Throughout each day, imagine a circle around your 2m out (6ft).
Notice who comes into that circle. Learn their names. Treat them with love.
Notice their needs, whether it's friendship, mercy, hope, or something else.
Consider how you might help meet those needs.
It's about trying to be more intentional not reactive. 
When you can, go out and try to put people in your 2m.

# Small Group Questions
- Where is your Jersalem, (where you feel safe)? How can you be a witness there this week?
- Where is your Judea, (Close to home)? How can you be a witness there this week?
- Where is your Samaria, (God can't possibly want me to go there)? How can you be a witness there this week?
- What are your fears, what are you scared of?

Remind them of 2m challenge.
Please pray for fears and trust in God.
